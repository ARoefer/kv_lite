# KV-Lite - Kineverse 2.0

This package is the second attempt at implementing the *Kineverse* articulation framework.

 - [Original Website](http://kineverse.cs.uni-freiburg.de/)
 - [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05362)

## Installation

The package is implemented as a ROS-package as it is mostly meant for the use in the robotics context, however, as of now (20th June 2023), it does not have a hard ROS dependency.

Clone the repository - preferably to a ROS workspace - and install the requirements using `pip`:

```bash
# In kv_lite
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In the case of ROS, build your workspace, reload it and you're good to go.

### Additional Dependencies

Some of the examples require additional packages. Currently it is

 - [roebots](https://github.com/ARoefer/roebots) a package collecting some utility functions for working with robotics. Used here for resolving ROS package paths without a running ROS core.

 - [prime_bullet](https://github.com/ARoefer/prime_bullet) an object-oriented wrapper for PyBullet which tries to offer a game-engine like interaction with the physics simulator.


## Usage

### Preamble

*KV-lite* is a framework for building and managing kinematics of articulated objects (doors, drawers, robots, general mechanisms). The aim is to be more flexible in the range of possible articulations than frameworks such as URDF, or SDF. These structures are managed as graphs, which can be compiled into analytical, differentiable forward-kinematic expressions. The expressions can be queried for their arguments, often also referred to as *(free) symbols*, for which a KV-lite model can hold constraints. In the end, these constraints and expressions can be used in any algorithm.

The general promise of KV-lite/Kineverse is: *If there is a closed-form expression for your articulation, you can use it.*

### Concepts

Before going to full models of articulated structures, we need to take a look at KV-lite's basic building blocks. Fundamentally, there are only four things:

 - Symbols: The variables of expressions. Implemented as `KVSymbol`.
 - Expressions: Some mathematical expression. Implemented as `KVExpr`.
 - Matrices: A structured arrangement of expressions. Implemented as `KVArray` as a specialization of `numpy`'s arrays.
 - Constraints: Triples of an expressions `lb, ub, e` which expresses the constraint `lb <= e <= ub`. Implemented simply as `Constraint`.

Let us look at an example of using these:

```python
import kv_lite as kv

# Creating our first symbol
a = kv.symbol('a')

# We can use a normally to build up symbolic expressions
e1 = a * 4
print(e1)  # >> (4*a)

# We have to use the symbolic functions from gm
e2 = kv.cos(e1)
print(e2)  # >> cos((4*a))

# We can inspect our expressions
print(e2.is_symbolic)  # >> True
print(e2.symbols)      # >> frozenset({KV(a)})

# Constant expressions also exist
e_constant = kv.expr(4) * kv.expr(5)
print(e_constant)              # >> KV(20)
print(e_constant.is_symbolic)  # >> False
print(e_constant.symbols)      # >> frozenset()
# Non-symbolic expressions can be turned directly into float
print(float(e_constant))       # >> 20.0

# We can evaluate expressions by assigning values to their symbols
print(e1.eval({a: 3}))   # >> 12.0
print(e2.eval({a: 2}))   # >> -0.1455...
print(e_constant.eval()) # >> 20.0

# Note two things:
#  1. All expressions always evaluate to float
#  2. eval() only filters for expected variables:

print(e1.eval({a: 3, kv.Symbol('b'): 2}))  # >> 12.0

# We can easily generate the jacobian of an expression
print(e1.jacobian([a]))  # >> [[KV(4)]]
print(e2.jacobian([a]))  # >> [[KV(@1=4, (-(@1*sin((@1*a)))))]]
```

In the last stages of the code above, we generate instances of `KVArray`. As stated before, this is the array implementation of KV-lite. It is a small extension of `numpy`'s `ndarray` type and thus supports all typical numpy array operations, such as indexing, slicing, stacking, and whatever else. All functions provided in KV-lite are vectorized, meaning that they broadcast across arrays. *Careful*: When given a container, KV-lite operations will **always** return a `KVArray`. Let us look at a couple of examples of using `KVArray`:

```python
import kv_lite as kv

# Let's create a couple more symbols for ourselves
a, b, c, d = [kv.Symbol(x) for x in 'abcd']

# CAREFUL: The left-hand side determines the array type, thus we create a KVArray here
m = kv.diag([1, 2, 3]) # Equivalent to kv.array(np.diag([1, 2, 3]))
v = kv.array([a, b, c]).reshape((3, 1))

r = m.dot(v)  # @ operator would work too
print(r) 
# [[KV(a)]
#  [KV((2*b))]
#  [KV((3*c))], dtype=object]

# KVArray's offer the same introspection as expressions
print(r.is_symbolic)  # >> True
print(r.symbols)      # >> frozenset({KV(c), KV(b), KV(a)})
print(r.jacobian([a, b, c]))
# [[KV(1), KV(0), KV(0)]
#  [KV(0), KV(2), KV(0)]
#  [KV(0), KV(0), KV(3)]]

j_r = r.jacobian([a, b, c])

# Typical numpy indexing works as expected
print(j_r.T)
# [[KV(1) KV(0) KV(0)]
#  [KV(0) KV(2) KV(0)]
#  [KV(0) KV(0) KV(3)]]
print(j_r[ 1,   0])
# 0
print(j_r[ 0])
# [KV(1) KV(0) KV(0)]
print(j_r[ :,   2])
# [KV(0) KV(0) KV(3)]
print(j_r[:2, 2:3])
# [[KV(0)]
#  [KV(0)]]

# Jacobian wrt foreign symbols is 0
print(r.jacobian([d]))

```

### Transformations & Spatial Types

Creating arbitrary matrices is fine and dandy, but also offers a growing set of implementations for typical spatial entities. By default, KV-lite uses 4x4 homogenous transforms as base representation for entities from SO(3) and SE(3). Let us look at a quick run-down of the options

```python
import numpy as np
import kv_lite as kv

# Create a homogeneous vector -> Not affected by translation
v = kv.vector3(1, 2, 3)
print(v)
# [[1]
#  [2]
#  [3]
#  [0]]

# L2 norm of a vector
print(kv.norm(v))  # >> 3.74165738...

# Create a homogeneous point -> Affected by translation and rotation
p = kv.point3(1, 2, 3)
print(p)
# [[1]
#  [2]
#  [3]
#  [1]]

# Create an identity transform
identity = kv.Transform.identity()

# A pure linear translation along the x axis by two meters
trans1 = kv.Transform.from_xyz(2, 0, 0)

# A 90 degree rotation around the Y-axis
rot1   = kv.Transform.from_euler(0, 0, np.deg2rad(90))

# A 45 degree rotation around v
rot2   = kv.Transform.from_axis_angle(v / kv.norm(v), np.deg2rad(45))

# An identity rotation from a quaternion
rot3   = kv.Transform.from_quat(0, 0, 0, 1)

# A combined rotation and translation
# The same exists for from_xyz_aa, from_xyz_quat
tf1    = kv.Transform.from_xyz_euler(2, 0, 0, 0, 0, np.deg2rad(90))

# Use Transform.inverse to invert homogeneous transformations
tf1_inv = kv.Transform.inverse(tf1)

# kv.Transform also provides some structured introspection into transforms
rot4   = kv.Transform.rot(tf1_inv)   # Generate a pure rotation transform from tf1_inv
trans2 = kv.Transform.trans(tf1_inv) # Generate a pure translation transform from tf1_inv

tf1_inv_x = kv.Transform.x(tf1_inv)  # X-column of transform
tf1_inv_y = kv.Transform.y(tf1_inv)  # Y-column of transform
tf1_inv_z = kv.Transform.z(tf1_inv)  # Z-column of transform
tf1_inv_w = kv.Transform.w(tf1_inv)  # W-column of transform - identical to kv.Transform.pos(tf1_inv)

# Of course, transform creation also works with symbols!
a, b = [kv.Symbol(x) for x in 'ab']

# A transform translating by 2a along X and rotating by b around Z
tf2  = kv.Transform.from_xyz_euler(2*a, 0, 0, 0, b, 0)
print(tf2)
# [[KV(cos(b)) KV(0) KV(sin(b)) KV((2*a))]
#  [KV(0) KV(1) KV(0) KV(0)]
#  [KV((-sin(b))) KV(0) KV(cos(b)) KV(0)]
#  [KV(0) KV(0) KV(0) KV(1)]]

# Transformations are chained by matrix multiplication
tf3 = tf1.dot(tf2)  # @ would work as well
```

### Symbol Typing

So far, we have always created all symbols using `KVSymbol`. This is fine for a general use of KV-lite and its symbolic math functionality, but to use its full modelling capabilities we must understand symbol typing. In KV-lite, it is possible to create symbols of certain types: Positions, Velocities, Accelerations, Jerks, and Snaps. These symbols behave normally, but have the additional feature, that they can be differentiated and integrated. Using this system, it is possible to create different constraints for the position, velocity, etc. of one degree of freedom of a model. Additionally, we can generate the tangent expression of an expression, which models the rate of change of the function at a given point, given the derivatives of it's symbols.
Let's make this topic a bit more approachable:

```python
import kv_lite as kv

# We create a few symbols modelling the position of degrees of freedom a, b, c
a, b, c = [kv.Position(x) for x in 'abc']
print(a, b, c)  # >> a__position b__position c__position

# We can generate the symbols referencing the derivative and the integral of a typed symbol
print(a.derivative())             # >> a__velocity
print(a.derivative().integral())  # >> a__position

# We cannot integrate beyond position or differentiate beyond snap
try:
    a.integral()
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(e)  # >> Cannot integrate symbol beyond position.

# Let us create an expression
e1 = a * 4 -b
print(e1)  # >> ((4*a__position)-b__position)

# We can now not just generate the jacobian wrt a__position,
# but also generate the tangent expression
print(e1.tangent())  # >> ((4*a__velocity)-b__velocity)

# Note: A typed symbol's tangent is the symbol of its derivation
print(a.tangent())  # >> a__velocity
```

Analogously to `kv.Position`, there are also `kv.Velocity`, `kv.Acceleration`, `kv.Jerk`, and `kv.Snap`.

### Models

All the mathematical tools we have seen before are used to build models of articulated structures. Models are represented by the `Model` class. KV-lite represents articulated structures as acyclic directed forest graph. The nodes in this graph define *frames* and are connected by edges, which represent the *transformations* between these frames. The graph can be queried for a frame w.r.t. another frame, which is calculated by traversing the graph and aggregating the transformations represented by the edges. If you are familiar with ROS' TF-tree, none of this will be new to you.
Lastly, the model also holds the constraints for the symbols used in describing the transformations. Constraints can be added manually, but generally edges can also define them so that they are automatically added or removed with the edge. The model can be queried for the constraints relevant to a given (set) of symbols.

Enough theory, let us look at a few examples:

```python
import kv_lite as kv
import numpy   as np

# km -> kinematic model
km = kv.Model()

# The frame "world" is always defined
# get_fk() returns a "FrameView" which holds the frame data 
# as well as the specified transformation
w_T_w = km.get_fk('world', 'world')
print(w_T_w)
# T (world -> world):
# [[1. 0. 0. 0.]
#  [0. 1. 0. 0.]
#  [0. 0. 1. 0.]
#  [0. 0. 0. 1.]]

# Name of the frame
print(w_T_w.name)       # >> world
# Name of the reference frame of the transform
print(w_T_w.reference)  # >> world
# Datatype of the frame
print(w_T_w.dtype)      # >> <class 'kv_lite.graph.Frame'>
# Original frame's data
print(w_T_w.frame)      # >> Frame(name='world')
# Homogeneous transformation
print(w_T_w.transform)
# [[1. 0. 0. 0.]
#  [0. 1. 0. 0.]
#  [0. 0. 1. 0.]
#  [0. 0. 0. 1.]]

# Adding a new frame with no additional data
km.add_frame(kv.Frame('lol'))

try:
    lol_T_w = km.get_fk('lol')   # By default we look up everything to "world"
except kv.FKChainException as e: # When no path is found, an exception is raised
    print(e)

# Let us create some symbols for different degrees of freedom
a, b, c = [kv.Position(x) for x in 'abc']

# Adding an edge connecting "lol" to "world" with a simple translation along X
km.add_edge(kv.TransformEdge('world', 'lol', kv.Transform.from_xyz(a + 1, 0, 0)))

# Now we can look up the forward kinematic of "lol" to "world"
lol_T_w = km.get_fk('lol')
print(lol_T_w)
# T (lol -> world):
# [[KV(1) KV(0) KV(0) KV((a__position+1))]
#  [0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0]
#  [0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0]
#  [0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0]]

# We can of course also look up the inverse:
w_T_lol = km.get_fk('world', 'lol')
print(w_T_lol)
# [[KV(1) 0.0 0.0 KV(-(a__position+1))]
#  [KV(0) 1.0 0.0 KV(0)]
#  [KV(0) 0.0 1.0 KV(0)]
#  [0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0]]

# Adding another frame
km.add_frame(kv.Frame('foo'))

# Add an edge connecting "foo" to "lol", rotating it around lol's Y axis at a distance of 1 meter
# Constraints need some name to identify them uniquely
km.add_edge(kv.ConstrainedTransformEdge('lol', 'foo', kv.Transform.from_euler(0, b, 0).dot(kv.Transform.from_xyz(0, 0, 1)),
                                        {'limit position b': kv.Constraint(np.deg2rad(-45), np.deg2rad(-45), b)}))

# Getting the FK of "foo" in "world"
foo_T_w = km.get_fk('foo')
print(foo_T_w)
# T (foo -> world):
# [[KV(cos(b__position)) KV(0) KV(sin(b__position)) KV((sin(b__position)+(a__position+1)))]
#  [KV(0) KV(1) KV(0) KV(0)]
#  [KV((-sin(b__position))) KV(0) KV(cos(b__position)) KV(cos(b__position))]
#  [KV(0) KV(0) KV(0) KV(1)]]

# We can now use the constraint query feature
print(km.get_constraints(foo_T_w.transform.symbols))
# {'limit position b': C(-0.7853981633974483 <= b__position <= -0.7853981633974483)}
```

### URDF

Manual model building is good to understand, but typically you will already have articulated structures specified as URDF that you want to load. KV-lite offers a few extension modules of the core functionality. One of these is for loading URDF files. The process is simple, but for this example we need the data from [prime_bullet](https://github.com/ARoefer/prime_bullet).

```python
import kv_lite      as kv
import prime_bullet as pb

from pathlib import Path

# Create an empty model
km = kv.Model()

with open(pb.res_pkg_path('package://prime_bullet/urdf/windmill.urdf')) as f:
    # Load the URDF into the model
    windmill = kv.urdf.load_urdf(km, f.read())

# "windmill" is a URDF-style interface to the model
print(windmill.links)      # Print the links in the model
print(windmill.joints)     # Print the joints in the model
print(windmill.q)          # Print position symbols
print(windmill.q_dot)      # Print velocity symbols
print(windmill.root_link)  # Local name of root frame

# Note that the URDF interface can look up FKs using the local link names
# It will try the local lookup first, then try to resolve names globally
wings_T_root = windmill.get_fk('wings', 'base')

try:
    wings_T_w = windmill.get_fk('wings')  # The default reference frame is still "world"
except kv.FKChainException as e:          # There is no connection between "windmill/base" and "world"
    print(e)

# Add a static transform between the base of the windmill and "world"
km.add_edge(kv.TransformEdge('world', windmill.root, kv.Transform.from_xyz(1, 0, 0)))

# Now the lookup works
wings_T_w = windmill.get_fk('wings')
```

### Exponential Coordinates

The current version of KV-lite includes an implementation of SO3/SE3 exponential maps transformations. This is just a brief overview of the existing functionality:

```python
import kv_lite as kv

# Generate an exponential map transform
tf = kv.exp.twist_to_se3(kv.vector3(1, 0, 0), 
                         kv.vector3(0, 0, 1),
                         kv.Position('q'))

print(tf)

# Create a model
km = kv.Model()
km.add_frame('foo')

# We can also use the transform as an edge
km.add_edge(kv.exp.TwistJointEdge(kv.vector3(1, 0, 0),
                                  kv.vector3(0, 0, 1),
                                  kv.Position('q')))

```
